# Bubble Protocol Community Privacy Policy

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines the collection, use, and protection of personal information by the Bubble Protocol Community app, part of the Bubble Protocol website. By joining our community, you consent to the practices described in this policy.

## Information We Collect
**Mandatory Information**: As part of the community registration, users are required to connect their digital wallet and register their social media usernames for Twitter, Discord, and Telegram.

**Optional Information**: Users may choose to provide their real name.

**Data Encryption and Storage**: Usernames are obscured through hashing with a secret salt before being published to the [Bubble Protocol Community smart contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xfF0795db0D1B09c00F9B01b23a1ff6b7556daA6F) on the Polygon blockchain. All personal data is stored in a protected file within a bubble held on the [Bubble Private Cloud](https://vault.bubbleprotocol.com) (a Bubble Protocol owned cloud bubble storage service), accessible only to the user (with read-write access) and Bubble Protocol (with read access). This data is AES-GCM encrypted with keys derived using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) to ensure only the user and Bubble Protocol can decrypt it. Importantly, the data is not stored in any external databases or servers other than the Bubble Private Cloud; it is read directly from the bubble whenever necessary, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and enhancing data security.

## Use of Information
The primary use of collected information is to facilitate community engagement, verify unique user registration via blockchain technology, and administer NFT rewards for promotional activities. Bubble Protocol commits to not using member data for purposes beyond these without explicit consent.

## Data Security
We implement advanced encryption and smart contract mechanisms to protect your information. However, we acknowledge the theoretical risk of salt extraction and brute force attacks on usernames published to the blockchain, which could, in principle, allow your wallet address to be linked to your social media usernames. We continuously evaluate and update our security practices to safeguard your data against unauthorized access.

## Data Access and Control
**Account Updates**: Users can update their personal data at any time through the site.

**Account Deletion**: Deleting your account will result in the removal of your personal file from the bubble, effectively erasing your data from our records. You can delete your account at any time through the site.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure
Bubble Protocol strictly does not sell, trade, or rent users' identifiable information to third parties.

## Changes to This Policy
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. Changes will be updated in this document, and we encourage users to review our policy periodically.

## Contact Us
For questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please contact us through the provided channels on our website.

**Effective Date**: 02-Feb-2024
